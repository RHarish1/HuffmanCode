## Description

This is a Python implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm, a widely used compression technique in computer science. Huffman coding is used to encode data in a way that reduces its size, making it useful for data compression and transmission.

## Features

- Text compression and decompression using Huffman coding.
- Easy-to-use interface for encoding and decoding text.
- Example usage provided for quick integration.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RHarish1/HuffmanCode
    cd HuffmanCode
    ```

2. Compress a text file:

    ```bash
    python main.py compress input.txt
    ```

3. Decompress a binary file:

    ```bash
    python main.py decompress input.bin
    ```

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
